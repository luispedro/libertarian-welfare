Why is health care so expensive in the United States?

Most other industries are dominated by \emph{almost as good and so much
cheaper} competition. Health care is dominated by \emph{just slightly better
and so much more expensive} competition.

\section{Should Vioxx be Back on the Market?}

The received wisdom on Vioxx goes somewhat like this: Merck was making a lot of
money selling Vioxx. It turned out that it caused heart attacks, but they did
not tell anyone. Finally, a lawsuit made them take this medication off the
market. Almost all of this is true, except that I think that Vioxx should be
put back on the market.

Yes, it does cause a slight increase in the risk of heart attacks (so much is
true). However, the risk is slight. In fact, it is about the same risk as
taking Ibuprofen. Except that, unlike Ibuprofen, it has a lower risk of gastric
complications.

Patients should have the opportunity to make these decisions by themselves.

What about Merck hiding the data? The story is a bit more complex than this. I
think that the scientists at Merck could have been a bit more forthcoming.
However, this is not a reason to punish the patients. The scientists involved
could be punished by the journal with a publication ban (and their reputations
certainly took a hit). If there is anything wrong with the FDA filings (but
recall that all of the information was submitted to the FDA), the FDA could
take regulatory action and fine the company.
