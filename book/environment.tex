\chapter{Environment}
\label{chpt:environment}

The environment is not, strictly speaking, a welfare state topic. However,
bringing up environmental concerns is a common objection to small government
(for many, it is \emph{the} objection to smaller government).

However, this is a topic in which small government advocates should have the
upper hand. Markets are great at optimizing resource utilization if we let the
price system reflect all costs (including environmental costs).
