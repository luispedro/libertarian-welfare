\chapter{Taxes}%
\label{chpt:taxes}

Are taxes too high? Here I think that the conservatives are just right: taxes
are too high. However, many of them are wrong on whom they are too high: they
are too high for low-income earners!

As Greg Mankiw has written, the current systems is, in fact if not in spirit, a
flat tax system. In fact, the current systems is \emph{much more of a flat tax
system than most so called flat tax systems}.

\subsection{Taxes on Thoughts}

``Means testing is a form of taxing the middle-incomes.''

``Conservatives are right on how high marginal tax rates can be damaging, but
do not often stress that the highest rates are paid by low-income people.''

``Complexity is regressive.''
