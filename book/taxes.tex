\chapter{Taxes}%
\label{chpt:taxes}

Are taxes too high? Here I think that the conservatives are just right: taxes
are too high. However, many of them are wrong on whom they are too high: they
are too high for low-income earners!

We need to distinguish between \emph{average} and \emph{marginal} tax rates.
The \emph{average} tax is very simple: take the amount that you earn pre-taxes,
the amount that went to taxes and divide one by the other. For example, if your
employer spends \$100,000 to hire you; while you get \$70,000 at the end of the
year, then 30,000 or 30\% went to taxes. Your marginal tax rate is how much
taxes you will be paying on your next \$1,000. This is often a very different
number. If your next \$1,000 only net you \$600, then your marginal rate is
40\%. % FIXME Check these values for plausibility

Unfortunately, things can get very complicated very fast as you are taxed in
more ways than just through the tax system. If you lose the right to subsidized
child care for you toddler or to cheaper health insurance as you cross an
income threshold, then your tax rate might be very high.

As Greg Mankiw has written, the current systems is, in fact if not in spirit, a
flat tax system. In fact, the current systems is \emph{much more of a flat tax
system than most so called flat tax systems}.

\subsection{Thoughts on Taxes}

\thought Means testing is a form of taxing the middle-incomes.

\thought Conservatives are right on how high marginal tax rates can be
damaging, but do not often stress that the highest rates are paid by low-income
people.

\thought Complexity is regressive.
