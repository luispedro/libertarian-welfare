\book{Free Market Fairness by John Tomasi}

In some ways, this is the same book as this one (but better written). It is a
philosophical treatment of the themes of this book. Its main argument is that
market friendly systems (market democracy) can satisfy Rawls' difference
principle while protecting a \emph{larger set of basic rights} than the social
democratic systems that Rawls himself preferred.

\book{Is the Welfare State Justified? by Daniel Shapiro}

Another philosophical treatment of the same questions, but with a stronger
emphasis on the argument that free market solutions are empirically more likely
to work, as opposed to the book above, which stays on the ideal-theory level.
