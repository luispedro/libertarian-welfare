\book{Free Market Fairness by John Tomasi}

In some ways, this is the same book as this one (but better written). It is a
philosophical treatment of the themes of this book. Its main argument is that
market friendly systems (market democracy) can satisfy Rawls' difference
principle while protecting a \emph{larger set of basic rights} than the social
democratic systems that Rawls himself preferred.

\book{Is the Welfare State Justified? by Daniel Shapiro}

Another philosophical treatment of the same questions, but with a stronger
emphasis on the argument that free market solutions are empirically more likely
to work, as opposed to the book above, which stays on the ideal-theory level.

\book{The Darwin Economy by Robert Frank}

The working title for \emph{The Darwin Economy} was \emph{The Libertarian
Welfare State}, but thankfully for me, Robert Frank changed his mind (also his
new title is better for his book and Libertarian Welfare State is better for my
book).

This is a more pop-economics treatment of its subjects. It is also a book that
has a more left-wing feel than my own. It often suffers from the \emph{curious
asymmetry} and, in many other areas, I feel that its conclusions do not follow
from the arguments. Still, in the end, there is a lot of agreement on policies:
that taxes are often better than regulation (for both liberals and
libertarians), that a progressive consumption tax has a lot of advantages, and
others. We should always be on the lookout for the possibility of policy
agreement even if we disagree on the fundamental justification of those
policies.
