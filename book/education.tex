\section{School Choice}

I agree with critics that say that ``school choice is not a panacea.'' But, who
ever said it was, or that it had to solve all problems to be a good idea? It
just has to be better than the alternatives. I could just as easily argue that
``assigned-schooling has not solved all problems,'' because it has not.
